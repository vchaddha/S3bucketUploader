# S3bucketUploader
Simple webapp using AWS services using which the user can upload objects and view/download them from their bucket upon authentication.

I have used the AWS Javascript SDK for this project. 

Below mentioned AWS Services have been used in this project:
1) AWS S3
2) AWS Cognito (User Pool and Identity Pool)
3) AWS SNS
4) AWS IAM
5) AWS Lambda

The webapp has two page views: 
1) Sign Up/Sign In Screen, and
2) Authenticated user screen - which shows user specific data
